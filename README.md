## Abstract

The Organation Application is designed to facilitate the process of organ donation by connecting donors and recipients efficiently. This project addresses the critical need for an organized platform to manage organ donations, ensuring timely and transparent communication between parties involved.

## Introduction

Organ donation is a life-saving act, and the need for an efficient and reliable system to manage donations is paramount. The Organation Application aims to bridge the gap between organ donors and recipients, providing a seamless platform for interaction and management.

## Literature Survey

A detailed literature survey was conducted to understand the current landscape of organ donation systems, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. This survey informed the development of our project, ensuring that our application addresses the most pressing needs in the field.

## Problem Statement and Scope

The main problem addressed by this project is the lack of a centralized, efficient system for managing organ donations. The scope of the project includes the development of a user-friendly mobile application that allows donors to register and recipients to search for available organs, along with various features to facilitate communication and management.

## Proposed Methodology

Our methodology involves a systematic approach to developing the application, including requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, and deployment. We used modern development frameworks and technologies to ensure the application is robust, scalable, and easy to use.

## Technology and Steps for Project

The project leverages the following technologies:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- **Android Studio**
- **Android SDK**
- **Firebase** for backend services

Steps for the project include:
1. Requirements Analysis
2. System Design
3. Development and Implementation
4. Testing and Validation
5. Deployment and Maintenance

## System Architecture

The system architecture is designed to ensure scalability and reliability. It includes various components such as the user interface, backend services, and database management. Detailed diagrams are provided in the project documentation.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

- **Hardware:** Android device with minimum 1GB RAM
- **Software:** Android Studio, JDK, Firebase

## Detailed Design Specification

The detailed design includes various UML diagrams such as use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFDs), activity diagrams, entity-relationship (ER) diagrams, state transition diagrams, class diagrams, collaboration diagrams, object diagrams, and component diagrams. These diagrams provide a comprehensive overview of the system's functionality and architecture.

## System Design
